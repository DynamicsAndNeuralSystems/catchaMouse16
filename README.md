> This is a collection of 16 time series features contained in the hctsa toolbox coded in C that can be run from Python, MATLAB and C, licensed under the [GNU GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (or later). Features were selected from the total set of [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/) features by their classification performance across a collection of mouse fMRI time-series classification problems. See the [pipeline and paper specific repo](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/Catchamouse16_paper_code) for details.

There is [comprehensive documentation](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/time-series-analysis-tools/feature-subsets/catchamouse16) for _catchaMouse16_, including:

- Installation instructions (across C, python, and Matlab)
- Information about the theory behind and behavior of each of the features,
- A list of publications that have used the _catchaMouse16_ feature set or specific time series pipeline
- And more :yum:
